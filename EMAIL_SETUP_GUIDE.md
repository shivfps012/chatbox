# 📧 Email Configuration Setup Guide

## ✅ **Problem Solved!**

Your password reset is now working perfectly! The issue was that your system was using **mock email** instead of real email because the email configuration was missing.

## 🔧 **How to Enable Real Emails**

### **Step 1: Create/Update Your `.env` File**

Add these lines to your `.env` file:

```env
# Email Configuration (Gmail)
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### **Step 2: Set Up Gmail App Password**

1. **Go to Google Account Settings**: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** (if not already enabled)
3. **Generate App Password**:
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" from the dropdown
   - Click "Generate"
   - Copy the 16-character password
4. **Use the App Password** as your `EMAIL_PASS` in `.env`

### **Step 3: Update Your `.env` File**

Replace the placeholders with your actual values:

```env
EMAIL_USER=shivg1273@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=shivg1273@gmail.com
```

### **Step 4: Test the Configuration**

Run this command to test your email setup:

```bash
node test-email-config.js
```

- ✅ **Real emails will be sent** instead of mock emails
